\# 23 - AI Support Ticket Routing \& Escalation



\## Description

This enterprise-grade n8n workflow automates the triage and routing of B2B SaaS or MSP support tickets. Upon receiving a ticket, it uses OpenAI to analyze the content and extract multi-dimensional data: Sentiment, Urgency, Category, and a Summary. It then enriches this data by querying a PostgreSQL database to determine the customer's tier (e.g., VIP or Standard). Based on a dynamic decision matrix (e.g., VIP + Critical Urgency), the workflow routes the ticket: sending an immediate Slack escalation alert to the on-call engineer and creating a high-priority issue in Jira. Standard tickets are routed directly to Jira with normal priority.



\## Nodes Used

\- \*\*Webhook\*\*: Receives incoming support ticket data (subject, message, customer email).

\- \*\*OpenAI\*\*: Analyzes the ticket text using a structured JSON prompt to extract sentiment, urgency, category, and summary.

\- \*\*PostgreSQL\*\*: Executes a query to fetch the `client\_tier` based on the customer's email address.

\- \*\*Switch\*\*: Evaluates complex, multi-condition routing logic (e.g., Urgency == 'critical' AND Tier == 'VIP').

\- \*\*Slack\*\*: Sends an urgent, formatted alert with `@here` mention to the IT escalation channel for critical VIP issues.

\- \*\*Jira\*\*: Dynamically creates a support issue, mapping the priority and labels based on the AI analysis and client tier.

\## How It Works

1\. \*\*Ingestion\*\*: The workflow is triggered via a Webhook receiving a JSON payload with `subject`, `message`, and `email`.

2\. \*\*AI Triage\*\*: The OpenAI node processes the text and returns a strict JSON object containing the extracted metadata.

3\. \*\*Data Enrichment\*\*: The PostgreSQL node queries the `clients` table to append the `client\_tier` to the workflow data.

4\. \*\*Dynamic Routing\*\*: The Switch node evaluates the combined data. If the conditions for a "Critical VIP" are met, it triggers both the Slack alert and Jira creation (Output 0). Otherwise, it defaults to standard Jira creation (Output 1).

5\. \*\*Action\*\*: The Jira node creates the ticket with dynamically assigned priority (`Highest` for VIP/Critical, `Medium` otherwise) and relevant labels.



\## How to Use

1\. Import the `workflow.json` file into your n8n instance.

2\. Ensure your PostgreSQL database has the `clients` table with sample data.

3\. Configure credentials for OpenAI, PostgreSQL, Slack, and Jira.

4\. Test the workflow by sending a POST request to the Webhook URL with a mock ticket payload.

5\. Activate the workflow for production use.



\## Prerequisites

\- A running instance of n8n (Cloud or Self-hosted).

\- An active OpenAI API key.

\- A PostgreSQL database with client data.

\- A Jira Cloud or Server instance with a "Support" project.

\- A Slack workspace with a dedicated escalation channel.



\## Setup Steps

1\. \*\*PostgreSQL Setup\*\*: Create a `clients` table and insert sample data:

&#x20;  ```sql

&#x20;  CREATE TABLE clients (

&#x20;      email VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,

&#x20;      client\_tier VARCHAR(50)

&#x20;  );

&#x20;  INSERT INTO clients (email, client\_tier) VALUES ('vip@example.com', 'VIP'), ('standard@example.com', 'Standard');

Credentials: Add your OpenAI, PostgreSQL, Slack, and Jira API credentials in n8n.

Node Configuration:

Update the Jira node with your actual Project Key (e.g., "SUP") and Issue Type.

Update the Slack node with your specific Escalation Channel ID.

Activation: Save and activate the workflow to generate the production Webhook URL.

Credentials Required

OpenAI API: For GPT-4o (or similar) text analysis.

PostgreSQL API: Host, Database, User, and Password.

Slack API: Bot User OAuth Token with chat:write permissions.

Jira API: Email/Username and API Token (or Basic Auth).

Use Cases

B2B SaaS Companies: Ensuring enterprise clients receive immediate attention for critical issues.

Managed Service Providers (MSPs): Automating IT helpdesk triage to reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).

E-commerce Platforms: Prioritizing high-value merchant support requests over standard user inquiries.

Customization Ideas

Auto-Responder: Add an SMTP/Gmail node to send an immediate, personalized acknowledgment email to the customer based on their tier and urgency.

CRM Integration: Replace the PostgreSQL lookup with a HubSpot or Salesforce node to fetch the client's lifetime value (LTV) for routing decisions.

Human-in-the-Loop: Add an approval node for edge cases where the AI confidence score is low or the sentiment is highly negative.

Zendesk/Intercom: Replace the Webhook trigger with native nodes for popular helpdesk software.

Notes

The OpenAI node is configured with responseFormat: json\_object. Ensure the system prompt strictly enforces this to prevent parsing errors downstream.

The Switch node uses $node\['Switch'].context.outputIndex in the Jira node to dynamically set the priority. This is a powerful pattern for complex branching.

Troubleshooting

JSON Parse Error: If the OpenAI node returns non-JSON text, the JSON.parse() expressions will fail. Ensure the model temperature is low (e.g., 0.1) and the system prompt is strict.

PostgreSQL Returns Empty: Verify that the email address in the Webhook payload exactly matches the format in the database (case-sensitive).

Jira Creation Fails: Check that the priority and labels fields are correctly configured and allowed in your Jira project's field configuration scheme.
