\## How It Works

1\. Schedule Trigger runs the workflow every day at 9 AM

2\. HTTP Request scrapes current prices from the competitor's website

3\. Google Sheets node reads the historical price data

4\. OpenAI analyzes the differences and identifies significant changes (>10%)

5\. IF node checks if there are any significant changes

6\. If yes: Sends alerts via Telegram and Email

7\. Finally: Saves the new prices and analysis to Google Sheets



\## How to Use

1\. Import `workflow.json` file in n8n

2\. Configure OpenAI, Telegram, Email, and Google Sheets credentials

3\. Create a Google Sheet named "PriceHistory" with columns: date, prices, analysis

4\. Update the competitor URL in the HTTP Request node

5\. Activate the workflow
