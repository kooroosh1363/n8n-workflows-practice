\## How It Works

1\. Webhook receives a job application (name, email, position, resume text)

2\. OpenAI analyzes the resume and returns:

&#x20;  - Extracted skills, years of experience, education level

&#x20;  - Technical score, Experience score, Culture fit score

&#x20;  - Overall score (0-100) and recommendation

3\. Based on overall score:

&#x20;  - Top Candidate (≥85): Schedule interview on Google Calendar + Notify hiring team via Slack + Send interview invite email

&#x20;  - Good Candidate (60-84): Send "under review" email

&#x20;  - Not Suitable (<60): Send polite rejection email

4\. All application data and AI analysis are saved to Google Sheets (HR Database)

5\. Respond to Webhook with the scoring results



\## How to Use

1\. Import `workflow.json` file in n8n

2\. Configure OpenAI, Google Calendar, Slack, Email, and Google Sheets credentials

3\. Create a Google Sheet named "Applicants" with required columns

4\. Activate the workflow

5\. Test with POST request to the Webhook URL
