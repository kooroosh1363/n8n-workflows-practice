\- OpenAI (AI Lead Scoring)

\## How It Works

1\. Webhook receives a new lead from the website

2\. HTTP Request enriches the lead data using Clearbit API (company size, industry, etc.)

3\. OpenAI analyzes the lead and returns:

&#x20;  - Fit score, Intent score, Engagement score

&#x20;  - Overall score (0-100) and Lead grade (A/B/C/D)

&#x20;  - Recommended action

4\. Based on overall score:

&#x20;  - Hot Lead (≥80): Slack alert to sales team + Personal email

&#x20;  - Warm Lead (50-79): Nurture email sequence

&#x20;  - Cold Lead (<50): Generic email

5\. All lead data and scores are saved to Google Sheets (CRM)

6\. Respond to Webhook with the scoring results



\## How to Use

1\. Import `workflow.json` file in n8n

2\. Configure OpenAI, Slack, Email, Clearbit API, and Google Sheets credentials

3\. Create a Google Sheet named "Leads" with required columns

4\. Activate the workflow

5\. Test with POST request to the Webhook URL
