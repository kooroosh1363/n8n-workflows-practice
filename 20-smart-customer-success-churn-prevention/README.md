\# Smart Customer Success \& Churn Prevention



\## 📋 Description



An advanced, AI-driven Customer Success automation system designed for SaaS and subscription-based businesses. It proactively monitors customer health by analyzing usage data, support tickets, and NPS scores. Using AI, it calculates a dynamic Health Score, generates personalized retention offers, and triggers targeted interventions (from urgent Slack alerts to upsell emails) to prevent churn and maximize Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).



\## 🔧 Nodes Used



\- \*\*Schedule Trigger\*\* - Weekly health checks and monthly executive reporting

\- \*\*Google Sheets\*\* - Acts as the CRM database for customer profiles and health score logs

\- \*\*OpenAI GPT-4\*\* - Calculates AI Health Scores, analyzes churn probability, and generates monthly strategic reports

\- \*\*Code Node\*\* - Generates unique, personalized retention discount codes

\- \*\*Switch Node\*\* - Dynamically routes customers based on their Health Score (High Risk, Medium Risk, Healthy)

\- \*\*Slack\*\* - Sends urgent internal alerts to the Customer Success team for high-risk accounts

\- \*\*Email Send\*\* - Delivers personalized retention, check-in, and upsell emails to customers

\## ⚙️ How It Works



\### Phase 1: Weekly Data Collection \& AI Health Scoring

1\. \*\*Scheduled Trigger\*\*: Runs every Monday morning to fetch active customer data from the "Customers" Google Sheet.

2\. \*\*AI Analysis\*\*: GPT-4 evaluates multiple data points (monthly usage, login frequency, support tickets, NPS, payment history) to calculate a 0-100 Health Score, churn probability, and identifies top risk factors.



\### Phase 2: Retention Code Generation

1\. \*\*Code Node\*\*: Generates a unique, trackable discount code (e.g., `SAVE-ENT-4829`) and determines the discount percentage based on the customer's plan and risk level.



\### Phase 3: Dynamic Routing \& Intervention

1\. \*\*Switch Node\*\*: Routes the customer into one of three buckets based on their Health Score:

&#x20;  - \*\*High Risk (< 40)\*\*: Triggers an urgent Slack alert to the internal team AND sends a highly personalized "Retention Offer" email with the generated discount code.

&#x20;  - \*\*Medium Risk (40 - 70)\*\*: Sends a friendly "Check-in" email with educational resources and an invitation to book a success call.

&#x20;  - \*\*Healthy (> 70)\*\*: Sends a "Thank You" email, requests a testimonial, and presents an exclusive Upsell opportunity.



\### Phase 4: CRM Logging

1\. \*\*Database Update\*\*: All actions, scores, and generated codes are logged in the "HealthScoreLog" sheet for historical tracking and audit.



\### Phase 5: Monthly Executive Reporting

1\. \*\*Monthly Trigger\*\*: Runs on the 1st of every month to fetch the "HealthScoreLog".

2\. \*\*AI Report Generation\*\*: GPT-4 analyzes the month's data to calculate predicted churn rates, estimated revenue saved by retention campaigns, and generates strategic recommendations for leadership.

3\. \*\*Email Delivery\*\*: A comprehensive executive summary is emailed to the leadership team.



\## 🚀 How to Use



\### Prerequisites



\- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)

\- OpenAI API key

\- Google Sheets account

\- Email account (SMTP)

\- Slack workspace



\### Setup Steps



1\. \*\*Import Workflow\*\*

&#x20;  - Open n8n and import `workflow.json`.



2\. \*\*Configure Google Sheets\*\*

&#x20;  - Connect your Google Sheets OAuth2 account.

&#x20;  - Update `YOUR\_GOOGLE\_SHEET\_ID` in all Google Sheets nodes.

&#x20;  - Create two sheets with the following columns:

&#x20;    - \*\*"Customers"\*\*: customer\_name, email, plan, monthly\_usage\_hours, login\_frequency, support\_tickets, nps\_score, account\_age\_months, payment\_history.

&#x20;    - \*\*"HealthScoreLog"\*\*: customer\_name, email, plan, health\_score, risk\_level, churn\_probability, action\_taken, retention\_code, analyzed\_at.



3\. \*\*Configure OpenAI\*\*

&#x20;  - Connect your OpenAI API credentials to both AI nodes ("AI Health Score Analysis" and "AI Monthly Report Generation").



4\. \*\*Configure Slack \& Email\*\*

&#x20;  - Connect your Slack API and update the channel name (default: `#customer-success-alerts`).

&#x20;  - Update `success@yourcompany.com` (sender) and `leadership@yourcompany.com` (monthly reports) with your actual email addresses.



5\. \*\*Activate Workflow\*\*

&#x20;  - Toggle the workflow to "Active".



\## 🔐 Credentials Required



\- \*\*OpenAI API\*\*: OpenAI API key

\- \*\*Google Sheets OAuth2\*\*: Google Sheets API access

\- \*\*SMTP Email\*\*: Email sending credentials

\- \*\*Slack API\*\*: Slack Bot Token



\## 💡 Use Cases



\- \*\*SaaS Companies\*\*: Proactively identify and save at-risk subscriptions before they cancel.

\- \*\*B2B Service Providers\*\*: Monitor client engagement and ensure high-touch clients receive timely attention.

\- \*\*Membership Platforms\*\*: Reduce member churn by offering targeted incentives and resources.

\- \*\*Subscription Boxes\*\*: Analyze customer feedback and usage to prevent subscription fatigue.



\## 🔧 Customization Ideas



\- \*\*CRM Integration\*\*: Replace Google Sheets with HTTP Request nodes to sync data directly with Salesforce, HubSpot, or Pipedrive.

\- \*\*Automated Calls\*\*: Integrate Twilio to automatically schedule a phone call from a Customer Success Manager for "High Risk" accounts.

\- \*\*Product Telemetry\*\*: Connect directly to analytics tools like Mixpanel or Amplitude via API to get real-time usage data instead of relying on static spreadsheet columns.

\- \*\*A/B Testing\*\*: Create different email templates for the retention campaigns and use a randomizer in the Code Node to test which messaging works best.



\## 📝 Notes



\- \*\*AI Prompt Tuning\*\*: The AI Health Score prompt is highly sensitive to the data provided. Ensure your "Customers" sheet has clean, numeric data for usage and tickets to get accurate scoring.

\- \*\*Code Expiration\*\*: The Code Node sets a 14-day validity for high-risk codes. Ensure your billing system (e.g., Stripe) is configured to accept and validate these codes.



\## 🐛 Troubleshooting



\*\*Issue\*\*: AI Health Score returning errors

\- \*\*Solution\*\*: Check the "Customers" sheet. Ensure `monthly\_usage\_hours`, `login\_frequency`, and `nps\_score` are formatted as numbers, not text.



\*\*Issue\*\*: Switch node routing everyone to "Healthy"

\- \*\*Solution\*\*: Verify the expression in the Switch node. It parses the JSON string from the AI node. Ensure the AI node is successfully outputting the `health\_score` key.



\*\*Issue\*\*: Slack alert not sending

\- \*\*Solution\*\*: Verify the Slack Bot has been invited to the `#customer-success-alerts` channel and has the correct posting permissions.
